        <p class="mb-4">STEMMechanics is a hands on education studio based in Cairns, created and operated by James Collins. Drawing on years of experience delivering digital learning, STEM programs and creative technology workshops across Queensland, James built STEMMechanics to give communities practical, engaging ways to understand technology.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">James' background includes work with State Library of Queensland, Education Queensland and a wide range of community organisations, where he delivered digital literacy programs, ICT support, eSports events, STEM initiatives and media workshops in both metropolitan and remote regions. This mix of technical, educational and community based experience shaped the approach that defines STEMMechanics today.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">At its core, STEMMechanics exists because learners understand technology best when they can build, test, break, remake and explore it themselves. James believes in hands on, curiosity driven learning that develops confidence, problem solving skills and genuine interest in STEM. Every program is designed to be practical, creative and accessible.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">STEMMechanics operates from a dedicated, private workshop in Cairns where James prototypes new ideas, experiments with electronics and mechanical builds, develops software tools and designs the kits used in his workshops. This workshop is the testing ground for everything delivered to schools and communities across the region.</p>
